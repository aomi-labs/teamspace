### Session Breakdown

#### Session 1: Workspace RMCP dependencies (01:01Z)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- **Issue**: User requested reading workspace dependencies at specific path
- **Resolution**: Session was brief, likely investigating workspace structure

**2. Code Changes**
- Analysis of workspace structure at `/Users/ceciliazhang/Code/aomi-product/chatbot`

**3. Key Insights**
- Workspace dependency analysis performed
- Understanding of RMCP (Rust MCP) workspace structure

**4. Documentation**
- No documentation files created in this brief session

**5. Next Steps**
- Further work needed on workspace configuration

#### Session 2: Extensive API Configuration and CORS Debugging (17:40-00Z)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- **Issue 1**: CORS errors preventing Vercel frontend from accessing backend API
  - Root cause: nginx was redirecting all HTTP requests to HTTPS, causing CORS preflight failures
  - Solution: Configured nginx to properly handle CORS headers and removed automatic HTTPS redirects for API endpoints
  - Resolution: Successfully enabled cross-origin requests from Vercel frontend

- **Issue 2**: nginx server configuration too restrictive
  - Problem: nginx only accepting requests with exact `server_name` match (api.aomi.dev)
  - IP-based requests (134.122.24.184) were being rejected
  - Solution: Created simplified nginx config accepting requests on both domain and IP
  - Added proper server blocks for different access patterns

- **Issue 3**: Backend API not accessible from external clients
  - Investigated port exposure and network configuration
  - Found backend running on port 8081 but not properly exposed through nginx
  - Solution: Updated nginx configuration to proxy requests to backend:8081
  - Added health check endpoints for monitoring

- **Issue 4**: SSE (Server-Sent Events) streaming not working through nginx
  - Problem: nginx buffering responses and breaking SSE streams
  - Solution: Added nginx directives to disable buffering for SSE:
    ```nginx
    proxy_buffering off;
    proxy_cache off;
    proxy_set_header Connection '';
    chunked_transfer_encoding off;
    ```

**2. Code Changes**
- **File**: nginx configuration (multiple iterations)
  - Added CORS headers: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`
  - Configured proper OPTIONS method handling for preflight requests
  - Added location blocks for `/api/*` and `/stream/*` endpoints
  - Implemented health check endpoint at `/health`
  - Disabled buffering for SSE streaming endpoints

- **Key nginx configuration highlights**:
  ```nginx
  # CORS configuration
  add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' '$http_origin' always;
  add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials' 'true' always;
  add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'GET, POST, OPTIONS' always;
  add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'Authorization, Content-Type' always;

  # SSE streaming configuration
  location ~ ^/(stream|api/stream) {
      proxy_pass http://backend:8081;
      proxy_buffering off;
      proxy_cache off;
      proxy_set_header Connection '';
      chunked_transfer_encoding off;
  }
  ```

- **Vercel Frontend Configuration**:
  - Updated API endpoint to use: `https://api.aomi.dev` or `http://134.122.24.184`
  - Configured proper CORS request headers
  - Tested both domain and IP-based access patterns

**3. Key Insights**
- **CORS Configuration**:
  - CORS preflight (OPTIONS) requests must return 204 status with proper headers
  - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` must match the requesting origin exactly (or use `$http_origin` variable)
  - HTTPS redirects break CORS preflight requests - handle HTTP properly first
  - The `always` flag on nginx headers ensures they're sent even on error responses

- **nginx Proxy Patterns**:
  - `proxy_pass http://backend:8081;` uses Docker DNS to route to backend container
  - Server name matching can be strict - consider catch-all blocks for flexibility
  - Location blocks are processed in order - most specific should come first

- **SSE Streaming Requirements**:
  - Must disable `proxy_buffering` to prevent nginx from buffering the stream
  - Need to clear `Connection` header to prevent connection upgrade issues
  - `chunked_transfer_encoding off` helps with SSE compatibility
  - Backend must set `Content-Type: text/event-stream`

- **Docker Networking**:
  - Containers communicate via service names (e.g., `backend`, `nginx`)
  - Port exposure through nginx requires proper proxy_pass configuration
  - Can expose backend directly for debugging but should use nginx in production

- **Vercel Integration**:
  - Vercel-hosted frontend needs explicit CORS configuration
  - Can use either domain (api.aomi.dev) or IP (134.122.24.184)
  - Should handle both HTTP and HTTPS in development

**4. Documentation**
- Created comprehensive nginx configuration with inline comments
- Documented CORS setup process
- Added testing instructions for various endpoints
- Included curl examples for health checks and API testing

**5. Next Steps**
- Monitor CORS functionality with Vercel frontend
- Consider SSL/TLS certificate setup for HTTPS
- Test SSE streaming thoroughly with real client
- Add rate limiting and security headers to nginx
- Consider adding request logging for debugging
- Set up proper monitoring and alerting
