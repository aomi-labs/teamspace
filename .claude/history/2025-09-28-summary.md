### Session Breakdown

#### Session 1: Backend API Deployment and nginx Configuration (21:06-16Z)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- **Issue 1**: Understanding backend deployment on DigitalOcean
  - Investigation: Analyzed Docker Compose setup on DO server
  - Found backend running on port 8081 with nginx on port 80/443
  - Solution: Documented proper endpoint structure and access patterns
  - Resolution: Clarified how to access backend through nginx proxy

- **Issue 2**: nginx HTTPS redirect breaking API access
  - Problem: nginx automatically redirecting HTTP to HTTPS before processing requests
  - This broke API calls from clients not using SSL
  - Solution: Modified nginx config to handle HTTP requests properly
  - Added conditional HTTPS redirect that preserves API functionality

- **Issue 3**: Server name restrictions preventing IP-based access
  - nginx only responding to requests with `Host: api.aomi.dev`
  - IP-based requests (http://134.122.24.184) were getting rejected
  - Solution: Created multiple server blocks:
    - Specific domain configuration for api.aomi.dev
    - Wildcard subdomain configuration for *.aomi.dev
    - Catch-all default server for IP and other requests
  - Resolution: API accessible via both domain and IP

- **Issue 4**: Testing backend endpoints with SSL verification issues
  - curl failing with SSL certificate errors
  - Solution: Documented workarounds using `-k` flag or proper Host header
  - Added comprehensive testing instructions

**2. Code Changes**
- **File**: nginx configuration on DigitalOcean server

  **Initial problematic config**:
  ```nginx
  server {
      listen 80;
      server_name api.aomi.dev;
      return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;  # ‚ùå Breaks API access
  }
  ```

  **Improved configuration with multiple server blocks**:
  ```nginx
  # Specific domain configuration
  server {
      listen 80;
      server_name api.aomi.dev;

      location /health {
          return 200 "OK\n";
      }

      location / {
          proxy_pass http://backend:8081;
          # CORS headers
          add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' '*' always;
          add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'GET, POST, OPTIONS' always;
      }
  }

  # Catch-all for IP and other requests
  server {
      listen 80 default_server;
      server_name _;

      location /health {
          return 200 "OK\n";
      }

      location / {
          proxy_pass http://backend:8081;
      }
  }
  ```

- **Test script created**: `/Users/ceciliazhang/Code/aomi-product/scripts2/test-backend.sh`
  - Health check testing
  - API endpoint validation
  - SSE stream testing
  - Both HTTP and HTTPS support

**3. Key Insights**
- **nginx Server Blocks**:
  - `server_name _` creates a catch-all/default server
  - `default_server` flag on `listen` directive makes it the fallback
  - Can have multiple server blocks on same port for different Host headers
  - Order matters: most specific matches first, catch-all last

- **HTTPS Redirect Best Practices**:
  - Don't blindly redirect all HTTP to HTTPS - can break API clients
  - Consider which endpoints need HTTPS enforcement
  - API endpoints may need to support both HTTP and HTTPS
  - Use conditional redirects or separate server blocks for different security requirements

- **Docker Networking in Production**:
  - Backend service exposed as `backend:8081` within Docker network
  - nginx uses `proxy_pass http://backend:8081` to route requests
  - Only nginx ports (80, 443) need to be exposed to internet
  - Backend remains isolated behind nginx proxy

- **Testing Production APIs**:
  - Can bypass SSL verification with `curl -k`
  - Use `-H "Host: api.aomi.dev"` to test with correct Host header
  - Health check endpoints (`/health`) useful for quick validation
  - SSE streams need special handling (no buffering, connection keep-alive)

- **DigitalOcean Deployment**:
  - Using Docker Compose for orchestration
  - nginx as reverse proxy in front of backend
  - Services communicate via Docker network names
  - SSL/TLS termination at nginx layer

**4. Documentation**
- Created comprehensive testing guide with curl commands:
  ```bash
  # Test health endpoint
  curl http://134.122.24.184/health

  # Test API with Host header
  curl -H "Host: api.aomi.dev" http://134.122.24.184/api/endpoint

  # Bypass SSL verification
  curl -k https://api.aomi.dev/health

  # Test SSE stream
  curl -N http://134.122.24.184/stream
  ```

- Documented nginx configuration patterns for different scenarios
- Added inline comments explaining each server block purpose
- Created troubleshooting guide for common SSL and proxy issues

**5. Next Steps**
- Set up proper SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt) for HTTPS
- Configure SSL/TLS termination in nginx
- Add request/access logging for monitoring
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Consider adding authentication middleware
- Set up health monitoring and alerting
- Document the complete deployment process
- Create runbook for common operational tasks
