Please create a comprehensive summary of today's work by:

## Data Collection
1. **Read all files** from .specstory/history/ that were created today (obtain today's date from your tools)
2. **List all history sessions** found for today with timestamps and brief descriptions

## Summary Structure
3. **Create detailed summary** in .claude/history/YYYY-MM-DD-summary.md with this format:

### Session Overview
- List of all sessions with times and main topics

### Session Breakdown
For **each session**, provide:

#### Session [N]: [Title/Topic] ([Timestamp])

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- What issues were investigated
- What solutions were found or attempted
- Resolution status

**2. Code Changes**
- Files modified, created, or discussed
- Functions/components added or updated
- Brief summary of changes (no full code unless critical)

**3. Key Insights**
- Technical concepts learned or clarified
- Architecture understanding gained
- Summary of any technical deep dives
- Important discoveries or realizations

**4. Documentation**
- Files created (.md, guides, references)
- Knowledge captured or documented
- Comments or explanations added

**5. Next Steps**
- Outstanding tasks identified
- Follow-up items noted
- Future work planned or suggested

## Content Guidelines
4. **Include specific details**:
   - Use file paths with line numbers: `file.ts:123`
   - Keep code snippets minimal and relevant
   - Focus on the "why" behind decisions
   - Cross-reference related sessions if applicable

## Sync to Teamspace
5. **Run the sync script**: ./.claude/scripts/sync.sh

Focus on creating a clear session-by-session record that tracks the progression of work throughout the day and makes it easy to follow the thought process and decision-making.
