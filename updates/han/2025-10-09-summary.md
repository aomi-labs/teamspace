### Session Overview
- 2025-10-09 11:41 (+0200) – Replaced baml_cffi by reviving in-tree cffi_support helpers
- 2025-10-09 15:47 (+0200) – Integrated BAML runtime so Rig tool calls stay stateless

### Session Breakdown

#### Session 1: Reuse cffi_support to drop baml_cffi (2025-10-09 11:41 +0200)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- Issues explored: Eliminating the `baml_cffi` dependency by leaning on existing `language_client_rust/src/cffi_support` encoders/decoders.
- Solutions attempted or validated: Vendored protobuf generation, rewired the client stack to the refreshed helpers, and confirmed the crate still builds.
- Resolution status: Guidance delivered with build validation; broader test sweep (including workspace tests) still pending.

**2. Code Changes**
- Updated build wiring via `language_client_rust/Cargo.toml#L9`, `language_client_rust/build.rs#L4`, `language_client_rust/src/baml.rs#L1` to use in-tree protobufs.
- Reworked FFI helpers in `language_client_rust/src/cffi_support/mod.rs#L1`, `language_client_rust/src/cffi_support/constructors.rs#L13`, `language_client_rust/src/cffi_support/decode.rs#L1`, `language_client_rust/src/cffi_support/rust.rs#L1` to avoid pulling `baml_runtime`.
- Pointed client/types surfaces at the new helpers in `language_client_rust/src/client.rs#L1`, `language_client_rust/src/client.rs#L243`, `language_client_rust/src/types.rs#L5`, `language_client_rust/src/types/raw_objects.rs#L1`, `language_client_rust/src/types/raw_objects.rs#L338`, `language_client_rust/src/ffi.rs#L19`.
- Regenerated test coverage through `language_client_rust/tests/ffi_encoding.rs#L3`.

**3. Key Insights**
- Keeping protobuf generation local removes an entire crate dependency and simplifies distribution.
- Reusing cffi_support primitives allows media arguments to stay in-process via `Arc` handles rather than external buffers.
- Existing lint noise (`mismatched_lifetime_syntaxes`) predates this change, so the refactor did not introduce new warnings.

**4. Documentation**
- No documentation updates were recorded for this session.

**5. Next Steps**
- Run `cargo test --workspace --lib` to validate the wider suite.
- Regenerate downstream language clients once the new layout is approved.

#### Session 2: Make Rig+BAML tool calls stateless (2025-10-09 15:47 +0200)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- Issues explored: How Rig currently registers tools, stores tool-call memory, and how to fit BAML-driven structured outputs into that flow.
- Solutions attempted or validated: Assessed the existing streaming/memory pipeline, then refactored the agent to let BAML own prompts, tool orchestration, and transient state.
- Resolution status: Implementation guidance completed with cargo build checks; further end-to-end validation still open.

**2. Code Changes**
- Introduced a `BamlAgent` path in `chatbot/crates/agent/src/agent.rs#L114` that wires MCP tools through a shared `ToolSet` and delegates prompting to BAML.
- Simplified streaming markers in `chatbot/crates/agent/src/helpers.rs#L95` so responses emit structured events while keeping wallet markers intact.
- Added runtime plumbing via `chatbot/crates/agent/src/baml_runner.rs#L9` and re-exported it from `chatbot/crates/agent/src/lib.rs#L13`.
- Defined the BAML prompt/contracts in `chatbot/baml/clients.baml` and `chatbot/baml/agent.baml`, pulling the Anthropic dependency through `chatbot/crates/agent/Cargo.toml#L25` and quieting warnings in `chatbot/crates/agent/src/docs.rs#L18`.

**3. Key Insights**
- Rig builds its tool roster before agent creation (`chatbot/crates/agent/src/agent.rs#L147`) and retains tool transcripts in memory (`chatbot/crates/agent/src/agent.rs#L363`, `chatbot/crates/agent/src/agent.rs#L424`).
- Streaming currently calls tools immediately and captures results in-band (`chatbot/crates/agent/src/helpers.rs#L100`, `chatbot/crates/agent/src/helpers.rs#L148`), which BAML can now intercept for structured handling.
- Stateless tool calling is achieved by passing `pending_tool` data back into BAML instead of persisting tool outputs locally.

**4. Documentation**
- New BAML prompt definitions in `chatbot/baml/clients.baml` and `chatbot/baml/agent.baml` serve as living documentation for the agent contract.

**5. Next Steps**
- Exercise a full end-to-end flow to validate the new BAML prompts and tool loop.
- Decide whether `pending_tool.status` should influence the BAML program logic.
- Update downstream documentation to note that `setup_agent()` now returns a `BamlAgent`.
