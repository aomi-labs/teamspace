### Session Breakdown

#### Session 1: FFI Architecture & Generator Fixes (2025-09-30T08:30:09.923Z)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- Mapped the `language_client_cffi` surface and described Rust/Go call flows plus value decoding differences across the bindings.
- Explained why Rust keeps `StreamingStateValue`/`CheckedValue` branches in `BamlValue` decoding while Go handles them inside serde helpers.
- Investigated the missing `.as_str()` helper on generated unions, added literal detection in the generator, and noted cargo test rerun is blocked by sandboxed network access.
- Stubbed the flaky media integration tests with TODO markers and preserved the original assertions per follow-up request.

**2. Code Changes**
- Tagged string-literal unions in `generators/languages/rust/src/generated_types.rs:74`, propagated the flag in `generators/languages/rust/src/lib.rs:185`, and emitted `.as_str()` helpers via `generators/languages/rust/src/_templates/union.rs.j2:66`; regenerated fixtures in `generators/languages/rust/generated_tests/mixed_complex_types/baml_client/src/types.rs:5353` reflect the new method.
- Replaced media tests with short-circuited stubs while keeping prior logic commented in `generators/data/media_types/rust/src/lib.rs:1`.

**3. Key Insights**
- Captured how Rust links `baml_cffi` directly while Go dlopens it, leading to different callback and lifetime strategies.
- Clarified the protobuf-to-runtime data flow for both clients, highlighting where conversions and buffer ownership change hands.
- Identified environment constraints (no crates.io access) as the reason generator tests still fail in evaluation mode.

**4. Documentation**
- Added inline TODO guidance and preserved legacy assertions in comments to ease future reinstatement of media tests.
- Left contextual notes in generator updates to explain the new literal-union branch.

**5. Next Steps**
- Re-run `RUN_GENERATOR_TESTS=1 cargo test --package generators-rust --lib -- mixed_complex_types` once network access is available.
- Restore media test bodies when deterministic offline fixtures exist.

#### Session 2: Daily Digest Request (2025-09-30T17:19:18.204Z)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- Collected today's session logs via `date`, `find`, and Python parsing, then organized topics chronologically for the digest.

**2. Code Changes**
- No repository edits; wrote the compiled summary to `~/.codex/history/2025-09-30-summary.md`.

**3. Key Insights**
- Confirmed Codex session history lives under `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/` as JSONL files and can be parsed with lightweight tooling.

**4. Documentation**
- Produced the daily digest for archival in `~/.codex/history`.

**5. Next Steps**
- Share or review the digest with stakeholders as needed.

Missing data/assumptions: Session timestamps taken from UTC metadata; generator test status still pending due to sandboxed cargo network restrictions.
