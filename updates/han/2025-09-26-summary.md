### Session Breakdown

#### Session 1: Implement union_types_extended according to the go peer implementation and the rust unions tests implementation (2025-09-26T06:21:43.368Z)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- Expanded the Rust union_types_extended fixture to mirror Go behaviour; initial assertions failed on array discriminators.
- Diagnosed products being coerced into `User` variants; updated generator to prioritise literal discriminators over structural matching.
- Clarified why `BAML_SKIP_GO_GENERATION` existed; ultimately removed the flag at the user's request so Go assets regenerate as before.
- Status: generator emits discriminator-aware unions; full regression still pending because dependent crates are missing locally.

**2. Code Changes**
- `data/union_types_extended/rust/src/lib.rs:16`, `:90`, `:192`, `:243`, `:292` – built comprehensive union tests, including discriminator checks and array coverage.
- `languages/rust/src/ir_to_rust/unions.rs:24`, `languages/rust/src/lib.rs:190`, `languages/rust/src/_templates/union.rs.j2:180` – plumbed discriminator metadata into templates so generated clients branch on `type`/`status` before falling back.
- `languages/rust/generated_tests/union_types_extended/baml_client/src/types.rs:3209`, `:3949`, `:4285`, `:4477` – regenerated fixtures showing discriminator-first decoding.
- `language_client_cffi/build.rs:345` & `utils/test_harness/build.rs:13` briefly gained `BAML_SKIP_*` gates; those edits were reverted by session end.

**3. Key Insights**
- BAML union deserialisation must respect literal discriminators to avoid structurally ambiguous matches.
- Sandbox-friendly generator runs require gating external toolchains (`protoc`, dylib copying), but those gates need product sign-off.
- Rust fixture gaps surfaced mismatches that Go tolerated due to discriminator hints.

**4. Documentation**
- Captured a step-by-step explanation of the union pipeline from BAML definitions through Rust codegen, highlighting where discriminators enter the flow.
- Recorded rationale and risks around `BAML_SKIP_GO_GENERATION` for future build doc updates.

**5. Next Steps**
- Restore `baml_client` dependency locally and run `cargo test --manifest-path data/union_types_extended/rust/Cargo.toml`.
- Re-run generator suites once dependencies resolve to confirm discriminator fixes hold across languages.

#### Session 2: What does sample tests do and what features are tested? (2025-09-26T12:59:55.869Z)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- Summarised coverage of sample generator tests across Go and Rust to orient the investigation.
- Investigated a SIGSEGV in `bar_stream_emits_partial_and_final`; initial fix retained the runtime on the stream consumer side.
- Follow-up fix kept the runtime alive within callback registry paths to prevent destruction during final tick delivery.
- Status: logical fix applied; awaiting confirmation via generator tests because cloud LLM calls are still mocked locally.

**2. Code Changes**
- `language_client_rust/src/client.rs:540`, `:574`, `:645` – ensured streaming APIs clone and retain the `RuntimeHandleArc` for their entire lifetime.
- `language_client_rust/src/client.rs:102`, `:134`, `:158`, `:172`, `:184`, `:198` – reworked `CallbackManager` entries so callbacks hold strong runtime references while sending ticks/results.

**3. Key Insights**
- Segfault stemmed from background callbacks dereferencing freed runtime state once the client dropped.
- Strong ownership (Arc) across producer and callback layers is required to make Rust streaming safe under abrupt drops.

**4. Documentation**
- Delivered a detailed walkthrough of the sample test matrix, covering collectors, streaming, diagnostics, and SSE parsing.

**5. Next Steps**
- Re-run `RUN_GENERATOR_TESTS=1 cargo test --package generators-rust --lib -- sample` to validate the lifetime fix.
- Monitor for additional collectors/stream regressions once remote providers are reachable.

#### Session 3: Summarize today's Codex sessions and print the digest (2025-09-26T16:02:27.403Z)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- Tasked with compiling a daily digest; gathered session logs and organised findings chronologically.
- Status: summary assembled and queued for archival.

**2. Code Changes**
- None – purely analytical/documentation work.

**3. Key Insights**
- Consolidating per-session metadata highlights outstanding runtime/test follow-ups from earlier efforts.

**4. Documentation**
- Generated today's summary for `$HOME/.codex/history/2025-09-26-summary.md`.

**5. Next Steps**
- Share digest with stakeholders; revisit unresolved testing actions from Sessions 1–2.

Missing data/assumptions: No direct diffs or test logs were captured in the session records; fixes await confirmation via `cargo test` runs that require external credentials.
