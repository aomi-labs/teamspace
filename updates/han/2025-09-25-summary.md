#### Session 3: Rust Generator Test Parity (2025-09-25T07:39:08.879000+00:00)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- Issues explored
  - `RUN_GENERATOR_TESTS` reported a compile failure: `collect_stream` called `stream.next()` on an opaque stream lacking `Unpin` (src/lib.rs:77).
  - `edge_cases` fixtures expected non-empty `related_items`, causing panics when LLM responses omitted that section (`data/edge_cases/rust/src/lib.rs:206`).
  - Follow-on requests to port the Go media, primitive, optional/nullable, semantic streaming, unions, and sample suites into the Rust harness, while handling OpenAI media constraints and a sample segfault caused by removing required env vars.
- Solutions attempted or validated
  - Wrapped streamed literals with `pin_mut!` and rewrote assertions to use generated union helpers, clearing the Unpin error and aligning expected values (`data/literal_types/rust/src/lib.rs:12`).
  - Relaxed circular-reference checks to validate each optional item independently, eliminating brittle assumptions (`data/edge_cases/rust/src/lib.rs:206-212`).
  - Ported Go fixtures for media, primitive, and optional/nullable suites, asserting real payloads and consolidating float tolerances (`data/media_types/rust/src/lib.rs`, `data/primitive_types/rust/src/lib.rs`, `data/optional_nullable/rust/src/lib.rs`).
  - After a temporary error-tolerant branch for media fixtures, reverted to the Go semantics so the Rust tests demand working clients once registry overrides exist.
  - Brought over sample, semantic_streaming, and unions tests, covering both blocking and streaming flows, and added `futures` dependencies where stream helpers are used (`data/sample/rust/src/lib.rs`, `data/semantic_streaming/rust/src/lib.rs`, `data/unions/rust/src/lib.rs`, related `Cargo.toml` files).
- Resolution status
  - All updated suites compile; runtime execution still halts without valid OpenAI/Anthropic credentials or client-registry overrides for media inputs.

**2. Code Changes**
- Files touched (include paths and line numbers when known)
  - `data/literal_types/rust/src/lib.rs` (pinned streams and union assertions).
  - `data/edge_cases/rust/src/lib.rs:206-212` (relaxed related-item validation).
  - `data/media_types/rust/src/lib.rs` (Go-parity assertions reinstated).
  - `data/primitive_types/rust/src/lib.rs`, `data/optional_nullable/rust/src/lib.rs` (ported fixtures and helpers).
  - `data/sample/rust/src/lib.rs`, `data/semantic_streaming/rust/src/lib.rs`, `data/unions/rust/src/lib.rs` (streaming parity tests).
  - `data/sample/rust/Cargo.toml`, `data/semantic_streaming/rust/Cargo.toml`, `data/unions/rust/Cargo.toml`, `data/recursive_types/rust/Cargo.toml` (added `futures`).
- Functions/components added or updated
  - Stream collection helpers now pin their iterators; union fixtures expose helper methods matching generated clients.
  - Added comprehensive harness coverage for the Rust sample, semantic streaming, and unions suites.
- Concise description of the changes
  - Reconciled Rust generator fixtures with the Go baseline, ensuring streams, unions, and optional structures validate correctly while preparing for credential-dependent runtime checks.

**3. Key Insights**
- Generator tests compile cleanly but still require real API keys; missing credentials manifest as runtime 401/timeout failures rather than build errors.
- Media fixtures depend on client-registry overrides that the Rust runtime does not yet expose, explaining the bad-request responses from OpenAI.
- Keeping `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` guards in place prevents crashing the harness when credentials are absent.

**4. Documentation**
- Multiple in-session summaries captured the rationale for each fixture update; no external docs were generated.

**5. Next Steps**
- Provision valid OpenAI and Anthropic credentials (plus BAML runtime env) and rerun the generator suites end-to-end.
- Extend the Rust runtime with client-registry configuration comparable to Go so media fixtures can target compatible collectors.
- Investigate the sample suite segfault once env guards are enabled to ensure streaming helpers remain safe.

#### Session 4: Aborted Summary Attempt (2025-09-25T15:47:48.424000+00:00)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- Issues explored
  - User requested a daily Codex session digest, but the agent stopped immediately after drafting a plan.
- Solutions attempted or validated
  - None — no commands were issued before the interruption.
- Resolution status
  - Task deferred to a later session.

**2. Code Changes**
- Files touched (include paths and line numbers when known)
  - No filesystem interaction occurred.
- Functions/components added or updated
  - Planning only; implementation never started.
- Concise description of the changes
  - Session ended during planning phase.

**3. Key Insights**
- Need to rerun the summary workflow in a later session to produce output.

**4. Documentation**
- None captured (only a draft plan existed).

**5. Next Steps**
- Execute the summarization steps in a subsequent session (which happened in Session 5 and now).

#### Session 5: Initial Daily Digest (2025-09-25T15:48:00.800000+00:00)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- Issues explored
  - Tasked with summarizing the day’s sessions into Markdown.
- Solutions attempted or validated
  - Located all `2025-09-25` session logs, sorted them by mtime, and wrote a Markdown summary to `~/.codex/history/2025-09-25-summary.md`.
  - Output enumerated sessions but lacked per-session details, calling out missing data for each entry.
- Resolution status
  - Partial: file created but required richer extraction (addressed in the current session).

**2. Code Changes**
- Files touched (include paths and line numbers when known)
  - `~/.codex/history/2025-09-25-summary.md` (initial summary draft).
- Functions/components added or updated
  - None — work focused on data gathering commands.
- Concise description of the changes
  - Generated a skeletal digest highlighting the need for deeper parsing.

**3. Key Insights**
- Recognized that session logs include structured summaries (agent messages) that should feed future digests.

**4. Documentation**
- First-pass Markdown digest stored in the Codex history directory.

**5. Next Steps**
- Enhance the summarizer to capture problem statements, code changes, and next steps — implemented in the current session.

---
Missing data or assumptions
- Session 1 had no user prompts beyond the environment handshake.
- Session 2 also contained only the environment context.
