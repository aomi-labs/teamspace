### Session Breakdown

#### Session 1: Rust runtime ownership & collector parity (2025-09-23T12:06:19+02:00)
**1. Problem - Solutions**
- Ensured Rust client keeps the runtime alive per `BamlClient` clone and auto-binds collectors before each FFI call.
- Introduced `RuntimeHandle` to own shutdown and guard the shared runtime lifecycle.
- Ported Go raw-object utilities so Rust exposes usage, log history, HTTP bodies, and LLM traces through typed wrappers.
**2. Code Changes**
- `language_client_rust/src/client.rs:31` now holds the shared runtime owner and binding hooks.
- `language_client_rust/src/client.rs:422` wires collector binding and result handling for every call.
- `language_client_rust/src/runtime.rs:1` defines `RuntimeHandle` as the single teardown point.
- `language_client_rust/src/types.rs:382` expands `Collector` to mirror Go capabilities.
- `language_client_rust/src/lib.rs:12` re-exports the new surface, while `language_client_rust/src/types/raw_objects.rs:103` implements cross-language raw-object dispatch.
**3. Key Insights**
- Collectors must bind to the runtime ahead of FFI calls so their handles stay valid.
- Raw-object traversal flows Collector → FunctionLog → LlmCall/LlmStreamCall, surfacing usage and transport details without unsafe access.
- Walkthrough documented the class conversion path from BAML values to native structs, aligning with streaming overlays.
**4. Documentation**
- Provided in-session explanations for collector use cases and end-to-end class conversion; no repo docs were added.
**5. Next Steps**
- Run generator/integration suites outside the sandbox to exercise the new runtime plumbing once permissions allow.

#### Session 2: Generator enum + literal fixes (2025-09-23T15:19:18+02:00)
**1. Problem - Solutions**
- Cleared `RUN_GENERATOR_TESTS=1 ... enums` failures by routing enum deserialisation through `FromStr`, restoring `Result::map_err` support.
- Sanitised literal variant names and keyword fields, embedding literal-kind metadata and helpers in the templates.
- Literal suite still failing because generated crates miss helper exports such as `RustLiteralKind` and literal value tables.
**2. Code Changes**
- `generators/languages/rust/src/_templates/enum.rs.j2:96` now emits `from_str` handling that returns `Result`.
- Regenerated outputs at `generators/languages/rust/generated_tests/enums/baml_client/src/types.rs:125` and `generated_tests/map_types/baml_client/src/types.rs:1017` reflect the fix.
- `generators/languages/rust/src/ir_to_rust/classes.rs:1` escapes keyword-backed struct fields via raw identifiers.
- Literal metadata and naming logic landed in `generators/languages/rust/src/type.rs:1` and `ir_to_rust/unions.rs:1`, with `_templates/union.rs.j2:1` and `generated_types.rs:1` wiring new helpers.
**3. Key Insights**
- Literal helper definitions must be emitted alongside generated crates to satisfy references.
- Union and literal naming requires stripping non-alphanumeric characters to keep generated Rust identifiers valid.
**4. Documentation**
- None beyond conversation notes.
**5. Next Steps**
- Inject `RustLiteralKind` (and companion literal tables) into generated outputs and rerun the `literal_types` suite.

#### Session 3: AGENTS guide & map_types diagnostics (2025-09-23T17:13:21+02:00)
**1. Problem - Solutions**
- Authored a concise contributor guide tailored to the Rust generator workflow.
- Reviewed `generated_tests/map_types/baml_client` to understand reported build issues; only unused-import warnings reproduced due to sandboxed `protoc` denial.
**2. Code Changes**
- `AGENTS.md:1` added (~371 words) covering repository layout, commands, style, testing, and PR expectations.
**3. Key Insights**
- Unused imports flagged at `generated_tests/map_types/baml_client/src/client.rs:14`, `generated_tests/map_types/baml_client/src/client.rs:16`, and `generated_tests/map_types/baml_client/src/types.rs:14`; otherwise code checks cleanly.
- macOS Seatbelt blocks `protoc --go_out` when tests try to regenerate Go stubs, explaining local sandbox failures.
**4. Documentation**
- New `AGENTS.md` now serves as onboarding reference for contributors.
**5. Next Steps**
- Share the guide for maintainer feedback and capture the exact local error if it differs from sandbox warnings.

#### Session 4: Legacy history summary request (2025-09-23T18:41:50+02:00)
**1. Problem - Solutions**
- Attempted to generate a daily summary from `.specstory/history`, but the turn was interrupted before work began.
**2. Code Changes**
- None.
**3. Key Insights**
- Highlighted the need to migrate legacy summary tooling, addressed in the next session.
**4. Documentation**
- None.
**5. Next Steps**
- Retry with Codex-aware instructions (implemented immediately afterward).

#### Session 5: Codex sync prompt refresh (2025-09-23T18:54:27+02:00)
**1. Problem - Solutions**
- Replaced the Claude-era sync workflow with Codex-specific guidance that scans `~/.codex/sessions` and prints a day’s digest.
- Ensured the command writes to `~/.codex/history/$today-summary.md` while still emitting the summary to STDOUT.
**2. Code Changes**
- `~/.codex/prompts/sync-today.md:1` rewritten to enumerate Codex sessions, parse JSONL, and format the overview/breakdown.
- `~/.codex/history` directory created so digests persist locally.
**3. Key Insights**
- Daily automation must sort sessions chronologically and handle embedded Markdown inside JSONL payloads.
**4. Documentation**
- Updated sync prompt doubles as living documentation for running the daily summary.
**5. Next Steps**
- Execute the refreshed prompt to validate end-to-end against real session data.

#### Session 6: Codex session digest assembly (2025-09-23T19:01:53+02:00)
**1. Problem - Solutions**
- Gathered and filtered today’s session JSONL files, trimming empty logs and extracting topics, code references, and open items.
**2. Code Changes**
- None; analysis performed via CLI helpers (`date`, `find`, `python`).
**3. Key Insights**
- Confirmed sessions at 07:34 and 16:54 were empty environment contexts and should be skipped.
- Noted outstanding literal helper work and map_types warnings for future follow-up.
**4. Documentation**
- Producing `~/.codex/history/2025-09-23-summary.md` to capture the full-day digest.
**5. Next Steps**
- Circulate the digest; follow up on unresolved literal helper emission and map_types cleanup as bandwidth allows.

**Assumptions & Notes**
- Sessions `rollout-2025-09-23T09-34-23-0199757e-bbc4-7eb3-8bb9-9fdafefc22ff` and `rollout-2025-09-23T18-54-01-0199777f-1449-7c61-93bc-559620574c0c` contained only environment context and were omitted.
- Session 4 ended before any assistant actions; details reflect that interruption.
- File line references mirror the paths cited during the sessions; exact line numbers may shift as the code evolves.
