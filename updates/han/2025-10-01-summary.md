## Session Overview

**Session 1 (Codex)**  
Focus: Deep dive into the `language_client_cffi` crate, particularly `src/rust.rs`, and the role of Protobuf in Rust client ↔ CFFI communication.  
Key Outcome: Clarified the layout of the crate, the responsibilities of each module, and how Protobuf underpins both the Rust client and CFFI layer.

**Session 2 (Cursor)**  
Focus: Comparative analysis of **data flow between Go and Rust clients**, including serialization/deserialization pipelines, Protobuf’s role, and architectural trade-offs.  
Key Outcome: Mapped out end-to-end serialization paths, identified key libraries and mechanisms in Go vs Rust, and highlighted differences in type systems, error handling, and performance.

## Session Breakdown

### Session 1 (Codex)

**Exploration Steps**
- Inspected files (`rust.rs`, `lib.rs`, `ctypes.rs`, `raw_ptr_wrapper.rs`, etc.).
- Investigated `RawPtrType` and its role in FFI.
- Checked `cffi.proto`, `build.rs`, and usage across clients.

**Findings**
- `src/lib.rs`: wires up the crate, exposes FFI entry points, syncs generated Protobuf APIs.  
- `ffi/`: contains `extern "C"` entry points decoding Protobuf payloads.  
- `ctypes`: translates between Rust structures and Protobuf.  
- `raw_ptr_wrapper.rs`: handles pointer wrapping for shared runtime objects.  
- `rust.rs`: provides high-level safe handles (`RawObjectHandle`, `CollectorHandle`, `TypeBuilderHandle`).  
- Protobuf (`cffi.proto`) is compiled via `prost_build` and used across Rust and Go clients for schema alignment and efficient cross-language encoding.

**Conclusion**
- CFFI layer bridges Rust runtime with other languages while hiding pointer/memory complexity.  
- Protobuf is the serialization backbone, ensuring consistency across clients.

### Session 2 (Cursor)

**Exploration Steps**
- Searched Go client (`serde/encode.go`, `decode.go`, `callbacks.go`).  
- Searched Rust client (`types.rs`, `client.rs`, `raw_objects.rs`).  
- Examined `cffi.proto`.  
- Investigated `BamlValue` serialization/deserialization in Rust and `CFFIValueHolder` in Go.  

**Findings**

#### Go Client
- **Serialization (Go → Rust)**  
  - Go structs → `CFFIValueHolder` (via reflection)  
  - `proto.Marshal` → Protobuf bytes → CFFI call  
- **Deserialization (Rust → Go)**  
  - Protobuf bytes → `CFFIValueHolder` → Go types (via reflection)  
- **Key libs**: `google.golang.org/protobuf/proto`, `reflect`, custom `serde` package.  

#### Rust Client
- **Serialization (Rust → Runtime)**  
  - Rust types → `BamlValue` (via `ToBamlValue`)  
  - `BamlValue` → `CFFIValueHolder` → Protobuf (`prost`)  
- **Deserialization (Runtime → Rust)**  
  - Protobuf bytes → `BamlValue` (via `decode_baml_value`)  
  - `BamlValue` → Rust types (via `FromBamlValue`)  
- **Key libs**: `prost`, custom `ToBamlValue`/`FromBamlValue` traits.  

#### Protobuf’s Role
- Defined in `cffi.proto`.  
- Provides a language-neutral binary format for values (strings, numbers, classes, enums, etc.).  
- Ensures all clients communicate consistently with the Rust runtime.

**Key Differences (Go vs Rust)**
- **Type system**: Go uses reflection; Rust uses compile-time traits.  
- **Error handling**: Go uses `error`; Rust uses `Result<T, E>`.  
- **Memory**: Go = garbage-collected; Rust = ownership/lifetimes.  
- **Performance**: Go incurs reflection overhead; Rust uses zero-cost abstractions.  
- **Serialization paths**:  
  - Go: `Go struct → CFFIValueHolder → Protobuf → CFFI`  
  - Rust: `Rust type → BamlValue → CFFIValueHolder → Protobuf → CFFI`  

**Conclusion**
- Architecture ensures multi-language support with a single Rust runtime.  
- Protobuf chosen for efficiency, consistency, and extensibility.  
- Go favors flexibility and runtime adaptability; Rust prioritizes safety and performance.

## Final Note

✅ Together, these sessions provide a **complete picture**:  
- Session 1 mapped out **CFFI internals and Protobuf’s role**.  
- Session 2 compared **Go vs Rust data flow strategies**, showing trade-offs in design and performance.
