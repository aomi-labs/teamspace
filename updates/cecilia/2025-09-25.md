## Session Breakdown

### Session 1: Docker Architecture Deep Dive & Production Deployment (19:15:08Z)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- **Initial Investigation**: User needed to understand development and production setup scripts, Docker configurations
  - Read and analyzed `scripts2/dev.sh`, `scripts2/configure.py`, `docker-compose.yml`, and docker directory contents
  - Verified Docker Compose configuration correctness for service networking

- **Port Configuration Tracing**: User wanted to understand how `MCP_SERVER_PORT: 5001` flows through the system
  - Traced environment variable from Docker Compose through container environment to application code
  - Identified key files: `chatbot/crates/mcp/src/main.rs:55-59` (server binding) and `chatbot/crates/agent/src/agent.rs:122-124` (client connection)
  - Clarified difference between `127.0.0.1` (localhost) vs `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces) for Docker networking

- **Docker Container Issues**: User encountered connection issues with Anvil service
  - Diagnosed connection reset errors on port 8545
  - Checked running containers and identified missing network configuration
  - Fixed by adding proper network configuration to docker-compose

- **Production Build Problems**: Frontend build failing due to missing environment variables
  - Identified issue: Next.js needs `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables at build time
  - Solution: Added ARG directives in Dockerfile and build-args in docker-compose
  - Created proper multi-stage build process with environment injection

- **Digital Ocean Deployment**: User needed complete production deployment setup
  - Created comprehensive deployment script (`deploy-prod.sh`)
  - Configured proper port mappings (frontend on port 80, backend on 8081)
  - Set up DNS configuration with GoDaddy A records pointing to Digital Ocean droplet

**2. Code Changes**
- **docker-compose.yml**:
  - Fixed service networking with proper host references (`mcp`, `backend`, `anvil`)
  - Added build args for frontend environment variables
  - Corrected environment variable references

- **Dockerfile modifications**:
  - Added ARG directives for `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` in frontend-builder stage
  - Fixed frontend runtime to properly handle production builds
  - Ensured proper environment variable passing through build stages

- **docker/mcp-entrypoint.sh:8-22**:
  - Added configuration helper integration for network URLs
  - Implemented fallback to default testnet configuration

- **Created deploy-prod.sh**:
  - Comprehensive production deployment script
  - Service health checks for all components
  - Proper error handling and status reporting

**3. Key Insights**
- **Docker Networking**: Services communicate using Docker service names internally (`mcp:5001`, `backend:8081`) while binding to `0.0.0.0` for external access
- **Environment Variable Flow**:
  - Docker Compose → Container Environment → Application Code
  - Static variables in Rust use `LazyLock` pattern for runtime initialization
- **Build-time vs Runtime Variables**:
  - Next.js `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables must be available at build time
  - Backend environment variables can be injected at runtime
- **Port Binding Patterns**:
  - Server binding: `0.0.0.0:PORT` (accepts all connections)
  - Client connection: Use Docker service names for inter-container communication
- **Multi-stage Docker Benefits**:
  - Smaller production images
  - Separation of build and runtime dependencies
  - Better security with minimal runtime containers

**4. Documentation**
- Created comprehensive deployment instructions for Digital Ocean
- Documented DNS configuration steps for GoDaddy
- Added detailed comments to Docker configuration files
- Created production deployment script with inline documentation

**5. Next Steps**
- Monitor production deployment for stability
- Set up SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS
- Configure logging and monitoring for production services
- Implement automated backup strategy
- Consider adding health check endpoints for all services
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments

## Technical Details & Code References

### Critical Files Modified
- `docker-compose.yml`: Service networking and build args
- `Dockerfile`: Multi-stage build with proper ARG handling
- `docker/mcp-entrypoint.sh`: Network configuration handling
- `deploy-prod.sh`: Production deployment automation

### Environment Variable Configuration
- **MCP_SERVER_PORT**: Flows from docker-compose → container → `chatbot/crates/mcp/src/main.rs:55`
- **NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL**: Build-time injection via ARG in Dockerfile
- **Network URLs**: Computed by `configure.py` and passed via `MCP_NETWORK_URLS_JSON`

### Service Dependencies
1. Anvil (blockchain simulator) - Independent
2. MCP Server - Depends on Anvil
3. Backend - Depends on MCP
4. Frontend - Depends on Backend

### Production Port Mappings
- Frontend: 80 → 3001 (container)
- Backend: 8081 → 8081 (container)
- MCP: 5001 → 5001 (container)
- Anvil: 8545 → 8545 (container)

## Session Progress Summary

This session focused on comprehensive Docker architecture understanding and production deployment setup. The work progressed from initial investigation of development scripts to full production deployment on Digital Ocean. Key achievements include:

1. Complete understanding of environment variable flow through Docker layers
2. Resolution of build-time vs runtime configuration issues
3. Creation of production-ready deployment scripts
4. Successful configuration of multi-service Docker architecture
5. Documentation of deployment process for team reference

The session demonstrated deep technical investigation skills, moving from debugging connection issues to architecting a complete production deployment solution with proper networking, environment configuration, and deployment automation.
