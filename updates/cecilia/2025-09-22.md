# Daily Work Summary - September 22, 2025

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Deep Dive into Wallet Connection State Management (11:29Z)

**Investigated `isConnected` State Flow:**
- Analyzed how `isConnected` is set across multiple system components
- Documented the complete flow: Wagmi → Hero component → WalletManager → callbacks
- Identified four key places where `isConnected` is managed:
  - Wagmi's `useAccount()` hook (primary source)
  - WalletManager state (lines 88, 112 in wallet-manager.ts)
  - AnvilManager for blockchain node connections
  - Hero component state updates via callbacks

**Architecture Understanding:**
- Explained WalletManager constructor with dependency injection pattern
- Detailed event-driven architecture with callback patterns
- Clarified separation between wagmi's automatic wallet detection and application-specific state management

### 2. TypeScript Syntax Education & Documentation

**Comprehensive TypeScript Learning Session:**
- Interface vs Class distinctions with practical examples
- Constructor patterns and event handler implementations
- React Hooks deep dive: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useSendTransaction`
- Complex type definitions including generic patterns
- Destructuring with renaming: `{ data: hash, error: sendError }`

**Created Technical Documentation:**
- Generated comprehensive `ts-syntax.md` reference guide
- Covered advanced patterns like `export type FunctionName<...> = <...>(...) => ReturnType`
- Explained intersection types and `Compute<UseMutationReturnType<...> & {}>`
- Real code examples from the project codebase

### 3. Development Infrastructure Enhancement (13:39Z)

**Automated Sync Script Creation:**
- Built `.claude/scripts/sync.sh` for daily work summary automation
- Script features:
  - Reads summary from stdin
  - Writes to `/Users/ceciliazhang/Code/aomi-teamspace/updates/cecilia/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
  - Automatic git commit and push functionality
  - Error handling for empty input and repository issues
- Made script executable and ready for daily use

## Technical Deep Dives

### React/TypeScript Patterns Explored:
- **Hook Patterns**: `useSendTransaction` from wagmi with React Query mutations
- **Type Definitions**: Complex return types with generics and intersection
- **Event Handling**: Callback-based architecture for wallet events
- **State Management**: Multiple layers of state (wagmi, WalletManager, React components)

### Architecture Insights:
- Event-driven design patterns in wallet management
- Separation of concerns between blockchain library and application logic
- TypeScript's role in enforcing contracts between components

## Progress Made
- Enhanced understanding of project's wallet connection architecture
- Created reusable TypeScript syntax reference for team
- Established automated workflow for daily progress tracking
- Improved development infrastructure with sync automation

## Follow-up Items
- Continue exploring other complex TypeScript patterns in the codebase
- Apply learned patterns to ongoing development tasks
- Use sync script for regular progress documentation
