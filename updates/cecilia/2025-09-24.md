## Session Breakdown

### Session 1: CSS Styling Questions (15:00Z)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- User needed to understand text sizes between `text-md` and `text-xl`
- User wanted to specify exact pixel values in Tailwind
- User needed explanation of layout utilities (`mx-auto max-w-full overflow-x-auto`)

**2. Code Changes**
- No direct code modifications
- Provided guidance on Tailwind arbitrary values: `text-[18px]`

**3. Key Insights**
- Tailwind doesn't have `text-md`, uses `text-base` (16px) as default
- Text size progression: `text-sm` (14px) → `text-base` (16px) → `text-lg` (18px) → `text-xl` (20px)
- Arbitrary values with square brackets allow exact specifications
- Common responsive pattern for tables/wide content: `mx-auto max-w-full overflow-x-auto`

**4. Documentation**
- None created

**5. Next Steps**
- None identified

### Session 2: Terminal UI Refactoring (18:01Z - 18:47Z)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- Terminal component colors needed adjustment to GitHub-dark palette
- Inline code was not rendering properly inline
- Mermaid diagrams were too small
- Frontend needed overall cleanup and standardization

**2. Code Changes**
- Applied GitHub-dark palette across terminal shell, tabs, chat window, and log panel
- Fixed markdown renderer to properly display inline code vs code blocks
- Normalized Mermaid SVG output to span container width
- Centralized markdown colors in Tailwind tokens
- Created reusable `GithubMarkdown` renderer component
- Converted images to `next/image` format
- Adopted `next/font` for font management (Inter, Dot Gothic, Source Code Pro)
- Set code block background to `#30363d`

**3. Key Insights**
- Centralized theming through Tailwind tokens improves consistency
- Separating inline and block code rendering requires careful markdown processing
- SVG sizing for Mermaid diagrams needs explicit width handling
- Font management through `next/font` provides better performance

**4. Documentation**
- Session summary captured in SpecStory history

**5. Next Steps**
- None explicitly mentioned

---

### Session 3: DevOps Knowledge Queries (17:51Z)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- User needed to understand Cargo package listing commands
- User needed Git push and PR creation workflow
- User needed understanding of GitHub CLI branch detection
- User needed explanation of bash parameter expansion (`:-false`)

**2. Code Changes**
- No code changes made

**3. Key Insights**
- `cargo install --list` shows globally installed packages
- `cargo tree` shows project dependencies (with various depth options)
- `gh pr create` automatically detects current branch as source
- `${VAR:-default}` provides default values in bash scripts
- Docker entrypoint scripts commonly use this pattern for configuration

**4. Documentation**
- None created

**5. Next Steps**
- None identified

---

### Session 4: Docker Architecture Documentation (17:51Z)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- User needed visual documentation of Docker build process
- Requested separate diagrams for compose architecture and build stages

**2. Code Changes**
- Created `/Users/ceciliazhang/Code/forge-mcp/docker-build-process.md`
- Added two comprehensive Mermaid diagrams:
  - Multi-Stage Build Process diagram
  - Docker Compose Service Architecture diagram

**3. Key Insights**
- Multi-stage Docker builds with 5 distinct stages
- Service dependencies: mcp → backend → frontend
- Entrypoint scripts used only for backend and MCP services
- Different port mappings for production vs development
- Environment-specific configurations via `.env.prod` and `.env.dev`

**4. Documentation**
- Created `docker-build-process.md` with detailed Mermaid diagrams
- Documented all build stages, service dependencies, and entrypoint usage

**5. Next Steps**
- None identified

---

### Session 5: Security Fix - Git History Cleanup (12:07Z)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- GitHub push protection detected Anthropic API key in `.env.prod`
- API keys were committed to git history
- Need to remove sensitive data from all commits

**2. Code Changes**
- Removed `.env.prod` and `.env.dev` from git tracking: `git rm --cached`
- Updated `.gitignore:15` to include `.env.*` pattern
- Cleaned git history using `git filter-branch` to remove sensitive files
- Force-pushed cleaned history to remote repository
- Cleaned up git references and performed aggressive garbage collection

**3. Key Insights**
- GitHub's push protection prevents accidental secret commits
- `git filter-branch` can rewrite history to remove sensitive data
- Must force-push after history rewrite
- Important to update `.gitignore` before removing files from tracking
- Git garbage collection needed after filter-branch operations

**4. Documentation**
- Detailed todo list created for tracking security fixes
- Process documented in session history

**5. Next Steps**
- Ensure `.env.template` properly guides new users
- Verify all API keys are removed from history

---

### Session 6: Docker Documentation Update (22:47Z)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- Existing docker-build-process.md needed updates based on actual Docker setup
- Documentation was incomplete and didn't match implementation

**2. Code Changes**
- Read all Docker-related files: `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.dev.yml`, `.dockerignore`
- Read entrypoint scripts: `backend-entrypoint.sh`, `mcp-entrypoint.sh`
- Updated `/Users/ceciliazhang/Code/aomi-product/docker-build-process.md` with comprehensive documentation

**3. Key Insights**
- Rust edition 2024 requires nightly cargo
- Backend entrypoint handles `--no-docs` flag via `BACKEND_SKIP_DOCS`
- MCP entrypoint handles `MCP_NETWORK_URLS_JSON` for network configuration
- Frontend uses standalone Next.js build for production
- Three separate runtime containers for better isolation

**4. Documentation**
- Completely rewrote `docker-build-process.md` with detailed architecture
- Documented all build stages, dependencies, and configurations
- Added specific details about entrypoint scripts and environment variables

**5. Next Steps**
- None explicitly identified

## Overall Progress Summary

Today's work focused on three main areas:

1. **Frontend improvements**: Enhanced the terminal UI with GitHub-dark theme, fixed markdown rendering issues, and standardized the codebase with proper font management and component architecture.

2. **Security remediation**: Successfully cleaned sensitive API keys from git history, updated gitignore patterns, and force-pushed cleaned repository to prevent security vulnerabilities.

3. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive Docker architecture diagrams and documentation, helping clarify the multi-stage build process and service orchestration.

The day progressed from simple CSS questions to complex security fixes and architectural documentation, demonstrating increasing technical depth throughout the sessions.
