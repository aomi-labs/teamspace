  - Add retry logic for API rate limiting

### Session 2: Troubleshooting go to definition in VS Code (17:15Z)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- **Issue Investigated**: Cmd+Click "Go to Definition" not working in VS Code for `baml_adapter.rs` while working for `storage.rs`
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Discovered nested workspace configuration preventing rust-analyzer from properly analyzing the discovery crate
- **Workspace Structure Issue**: Found that `baml_adapter.rs` was in a non-member crate due to nested workspace setup
- **Solution Applied**: Added `.vscode/settings.json` configuration to specify linked projects for rust-analyzer
- **Resolution Status**: ✅ Successfully resolved with VS Code restart and proper workspace configuration

**2. Code Changes**
- **Files Created**:
  - `.vscode/settings.json` - VS Code workspace configuration for rust-analyzer
- **Configuration Added**:
  - `rust-analyzer.linkedProjects` setting pointing to discovery crate
  - Proper workspace member specification for nested crate structure

**3. Key Insights**
- **Workspace Architecture**: Understood how nested Cargo workspaces can break IDE tooling
- **Rust-analyzer Configuration**: Learned about `linkedProjects` setting for complex workspace structures
- **IDE Troubleshooting**: Gained experience diagnosing language server issues in multi-crate projects
- **Development Environment**: Recognized importance of proper IDE setup for productivity

**4. Documentation**
- **Knowledge Captured**: Understanding of rust-analyzer configuration for nested workspaces
- **Troubleshooting Process**: Documented systematic approach to IDE language server issues

**5. Next Steps**
- **Follow-up Items**: Monitor for similar issues in other nested crates within the workspace

### Session 3: Integrate contract info into ContractInfo structs (20:25Z)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- **Issue Investigated**: Need to integrate Etherscan client data with BAML ContractInfo structs for complete workflow
