# Daily Work Summary - September 25, 2025

### Session Overview
- Summarize recent project progress — Start 17:46Z, End 17:57Z
- You're an expert Prompt Engineer — Start 17:46Z, End 17:46Z
- Parallel Handler Execution — Start 17:57Z, End 02:00Z (next day)
- Having a problem — Start 18:14Z, End 21:34Z

### Session Breakdown

#### Session 1: Summarize recent project progress (Start 17:46Z)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- Goal: Capture recent progress and align Phase 3 priorities before Phase 4.
- Solution: Summarized Etherscan → BAML pipeline, multi-network support, HandlerGenerator integration, and security enhancements; agreed to finalize Phase 3 tests first.
- Status: ✅ Summary and priorities established.

**2. Code Changes**
- No new code; referenced prior changes across `etherscan.rs`, `baml_adapter.rs`, and BAML functions.

**3. Key Insights**
- Phase 2 is stable; Phase 3 needs assertion hardening for handler params before Phase 4.

**4. Documentation**
- Consolidated progress notes to guide test work.

**5. Next Steps**
- Enhance `test_contract_address_to_handler_generator_response_workflow` to verify `HandlersInvocationParam`.

#### Session 2: You're an expert Prompt Engineer (Start 17:46Z)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- Need webapps that crawl sites into LLM-ingestable docs.
- Solution: Identified Firecrawl; alternatives: Apify Content Crawler, Diffbot, Markprompt, Zyte API, Danswer.
- Status: ✅ Options documented.

**2. Code Changes**
- None.

**3. Key Insights**
- Several options exist with Markdown/JSON outputs suitable for RAG.

**4. Documentation**
- Listed tools and links.

**5. Next Steps**
- Choose and integrate a crawler into the knowledge ingestion workflow.

#### Session 3: Parallel Handler Execution (Start 17:57Z, End 02:00Z next day)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- Need scalable, dependency-aware parallel execution for discovery handlers.
- Solutions:
  - Designed Bridge (BAML → internal handlers), Runner (parallel with dependencies), Service (end-to-end).
  - Implemented Step 1: Simplify the Bridge; created `baml_to_handlers_bridge.rs`, `discovery_workflow_runner.rs`, `discovery_orchestrator.rs` scaffolds; planned tests.
- Status: ✅ Step 1 complete; Steps 2–3 pending (add handler config, update tests).

**2. Code Changes**
- Proposed/created files and refactors around discovery execution layers.

**3. Key Insights**
- Splitting concerns improves testability and parallel orchestration; identified model mismatch and configuration gaps.

**4. Documentation**
- Extensive design notes, TODOs, and recommended next actions; testing strategy drafted.

**5. Next Steps**
- Add missing handler configuration; implement parallel execution tests; extend handler types.

#### Session 4: Having a problem (Start 18:14Z)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- Observed git push error “Could not resolve host: github.com”.
- Diagnostics showed DNS resolution works; reviewed remotes and proxy settings; HTTP connectivity to GitHub OK via curl.
- Status: ✅ Connectivity verified; likely transient or environment-specific Git issue; steps documented.

**2. Code Changes**
- None.

**3. Key Insights**
- When Git reports host resolution errors but curl/dig succeed, inspect Git config/proxy and retry.

**4. Documentation**
- Captured diagnostic outputs and minimal remediation steps.

**5. Next Steps**
- Reattempt push; verify `.gitconfig` proxy settings; consider SSH remote as fallback.

### Content Guidelines
- Included session start and end times from first/last user timestamps in each file.
- Focused on why decisions were made and architecture impacts.
- Referenced key files and modules where applicable.
