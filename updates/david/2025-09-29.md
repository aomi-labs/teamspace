### Session Breakdown

#### Session 1: Let's coordinate for today (2025-09-30 02:54Z)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- Issues investigated:
  - Create a clear daily summary from `.specstory/history` files
  - Thoroughly review the latter 2/3 of the organizing Rust code phases session to extract final design decisions and concrete steps
  - Capture code changes and tests related to the typestate-based discovery refactor
- Solutions found/attempted:
  - Read the full "2025-09-29_20-56Z-organizing-rust-code-for-project-phases.md" (last 2/3 emphasized) to extract Phase 6–8 architecture, termination logic, and multi-protocol orchestration
  - Identify and list concrete code artifacts and tests added in the discovery crate
  - Prepare next steps centered on Phase 3 (generation) and Phase 4 (execution)
- Resolution status: Summary compiled; ready to sync to teamspace

**2. Code Changes**
- Files modified/created (discovery crate only):
  - `crates/application/discovery/src/lib.rs:11` — module export for orchestrator
  - `crates/application/discovery/src/orchestrator.rs:38` — `DiscoverySession<State>` type introduced
  - `crates/application/discovery/tests/typestate_integration_tests.rs:19` — `test_planning_to_fetching_transition`
  - New modules: `crates/application/discovery/src/phases/{planning.rs, fetch.rs, generation.rs, execution.rs, recovery.rs}`
  - New helper: `crates/application/discovery/src/baml/client.rs`
- Functions/components added or updated (high level):
  - Typestate core: `DiscoverySession<State>` with zero-sized phase markers; compile-time-enforced transitions
  - Planning path: `plan_discovery(...)` and `DiscoverySession<Planning>::plan(...)` producing `Fetching`
  - Integration test scaffolding for Planning → Fetching transition
- Brief summary of changes:
  - Established typestate skeleton and module layout in the discovery crate
  - Added BAML client config helper for local development
  - Confirmed Planning → Fetching transition via integration test

**3. Key Insights**
- Typestate pattern: zero-sized phase markers provide compile-time safety with zero runtime overhead
- Phase 6 (Cycle Continuation): explicit `AnalysisResult::Continue` loops back to `Fetching`; track depth to avoid infinite exploration
- Phase 7 (Multi-Protocol): `MultiProtocolDiscovery` advances sessions per-protocol (parallelizable), isolates failures, aggregates progress
- Phase 8 (Completion): multiple termination paths (intent satisfied, max depth, errors, resource limits) with rich summaries and `is_success()`

**4. Next Steps**
- Implement Phase 3 (Handler Generation) and Phase 4 (Handler Execution), with strong tests
- Maintain changes strictly within `crates/application/discovery/`
- Add compile-fail docs later for invalid transitions, if useful
- Sync this summary to teamspace
