### Session Breakdown
#### Session 1: Testing handler generation from contract address (2025-09-26 21:26Z)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- What issues were investigated
  - Verify the workflow can not only generate `HandlerGeneratorResponse` but also construct concrete handlers and execute them respecting dependencies.
  - Decide whether to build handlers via the existing bridge or define them directly per `config.rs` (avoid the bridge for this test path).
  - Determine execution order based on dependencies and ensure results are produced in a stable, deadlock-free sequence.
- What solutions were found or attempted
  - Add a test (e.g., `test_handler_creation_from_generator_response`) that:
    - Runs the workflow, extracts handler definitions, instantiates concrete handlers (Call, Array, Storage).
    - Sets up a provider (local Anvil) and executes handlers while checking dependency readiness before each run.
  - Alternative path: skip the bridge and create handler definitions exactly as specified in `config.rs` to exercise execution directly.
- Resolution status
  - Plan and approach documented in-session; implementation pending.

**2. Code Changes**
- Files modified, created, or discussed
  - `crates/drivers/eth-driver/src/handlers/types.rs`
  - `crates/drivers/eth-driver/src/handlers/call.rs`
  - `crates/drivers/eth-driver/src/handlers/array.rs`
  - `crates/drivers/eth-driver/src/handlers/config.rs`
  - `crates/application/discovery/src/baml_adapter.rs`
  - `crates/application/discovery/generated/rust/baml_client/src/models/handler_config.rs`
  - `crates/application/discovery/src/baml_to_handlers_bridge.rs`
- Functions/components added or updated
  - Handler instantiation from definitions (Call/Array/Storage) discussed.
  - Dependency-aware wave execution logic (independent first, then dependent waves) discussed.
- Brief summary of changes
  - No code edits recorded in this session; reviewed components and planned tests.

**3. Key Insights**
- Technical concepts learned or clarified
  - Dependencies are expressed via reference placeholders (e.g., `{{ fieldName }}`) within handler configs; concrete handlers expose `dependencies()` built from these references.
  - The runner partitions handlers into independent vs dependent; executes in waves until all dependencies are satisfied or a deadlock is detected.
- Architecture understanding gained
  - For direct tests, it may be clearer to bypass the bridge and mirror definitions from `config.rs` to focus on execution behavior.
- Important discoveries or realizations
  - A negative test for deadlock detection will validate correctness of dependency handling.

**4. Documentation**
- Files created (.md, guides, references)
  - This summary document.
- Knowledge captured or documented
  - Test approach and execution strategy for handler creation and dependency-based scheduling.

**5. Next Steps**
- Outstanding tasks identified
  - Implement the test that creates handlers from definitions and executes them with dependency checks.
  - Add a negative test to assert deadlock detection when dependencies cannot be fulfilled.
- Future work planned or suggested
  - Optionally integrate with BAML server + Anvil for end-to-end validation.
