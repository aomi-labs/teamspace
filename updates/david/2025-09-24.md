### Session Overview
- Session 1: Enhance Etherscan client for multiple networks (12:06Z)
- Session 2: Refactor proposal for module structure (15:32Z)
- Session 3: Complete HandlerGenerator integration flow (20:13Z)
- Session 4: Enhancing security for GitHub repositories (23:56Z)

### Session Breakdown

#### Session 1: Enhance Etherscan client for multiple networks (12:06Z)
- Problem - Solutions
  - Need multi-network support (Mainnet, Goerli, Sepolia, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base)
  - Added `Network` enum, parsing, defaults, and constructors to `EtherscanClient`
  - Verified via unit tests and demo printouts
- Code Changes
  - crates/application/discovery/src/etherscan.rs: Added `Network` enum and client updates
  - Added constructors and tests; validated parsing, defaults, and config
- Key Insights
  - Type-safe network selection improves clarity and extensibility
  - Kept backward compatibility by defaulting to mainnet
- Next Steps
  - Add providers crate move when stable; keep tests green during restructure

#### Session 2: Refactor proposal for module structure (15:32Z)
- Problem - Solutions
  - Improve separation of concerns and adhere to SRP
  - Created `abi.rs`; moved ABI parsing and tests from `baml_adapter.rs`
  - Updated `lib.rs` exports and adapter usage
- Code Changes
  - crates/application/discovery/src/abi.rs: New module + tests
  - crates/application/discovery/src/lib.rs: Export `abi`
  - crates/application/discovery/src/baml_adapter.rs: Use new `abi` module
- Key Insights
  - Cleaner boundaries; easier reuse and testing
- Next Steps
  - Continue incremental refactors; avoid large simultaneous moves

#### Session 3: Complete HandlerGenerator integration flow (20:13Z)
- Problem - Solutions
  - Connect Etherscan → BAML ContractInfo → HandlerGenerator decision
  - Implemented `decide_handlers_for_contracts` with robust tests for both outcomes
  - Added resilience (delay for DNS), deterministic validation, and clearer logs
- Code Changes
  - crates/application/discovery/src/baml_adapter.rs: Added full decision workflow tests
  - crates/application/discovery/src/main.rs: Example usage updated
- Key Insights
  - Deterministic tests reduce LLM variability flakiness
  - Graceful degradation when classification fails (keep "unknown")
- Next Steps
  - Reuse fetched contract info between calls; minimize network duplication

#### Session 4: Enhancing security for GitHub repositories (23:56Z)
- Problem - Solutions
  - Risk of exposing secrets in public repos
  - Proposed layered approach: GitHub Secret Scanning + Push Protection, Gitleaks, TruffleHog
- Documentation
  - Captured pros, free tiers, and setup steps for each tool
- Next Steps
  - Enable org-wide scanning for public repos; add CI jobs and pre-commit hooks

### Key Achievements
- Multi-network Etherscan client with validated tests
- ABI parsing isolated in `abi.rs` with passing tests
- End-to-end HandlerGenerator decision workflow validated for both branches
- Security posture improvements plan documented
