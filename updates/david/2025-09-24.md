### Session Breakdown

#### Session 1: Enhance Etherscan client for multiple networks (Start 07:07Z, End 12:06Z)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- Need to extend `etherscan.rs` beyond mainnet to support additional networks (Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, etc.).
- Implemented `Network` enum and URL mapping; parameterized client to target different networks.
- Ensured API key loading and error handling are consistent across networks.
- Status: ✅ Multi-network support designed and implemented.

**2. Code Changes**
- `crates/application/discovery/src/etherscan.rs` — Added `Network` enum, `get_api_url()`, updated `EtherscanClient` to accept per-network config.
- `crates/application/discovery/Cargo.toml` — Confirmed HTTP/serde deps sufficient for new code paths.

**3. Key Insights**
- Centralizing network configuration simplifies scaling to new chains.
- Type-safe `Network` dramatically reduces URL/param errors.

**4. Documentation**
- Added inline docs on supported networks and how to select them.

**5. Next Steps**
- Add rate limiting/backoff and caching per network.
- Expose CLI flag/env to select network at runtime.

#### Session 2: Refactor proposal for module structure (Start 07:41Z, End 15:32Z)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- `baml_adapter.rs` was handling ABI parsing, which is outside its responsibility.
- Proposed moving ABI parsing to a dedicated module to follow SRP and improve testability.
- Status: ✅ Refactor plan defined; extraction points identified.

**2. Code Changes**
- Target files: `crates/application/discovery/src/baml_adapter.rs` (remove parsing), new module (e.g., `abi.rs`), update `crates/application/discovery/src/lib.rs` exports.

**3. Key Insights**
- Clear boundaries: `baml_adapter` should focus on BAML I/O and conversions, not parsing.

**4. Documentation**
- Captured refactor plan with responsibilities and migration steps.

**5. Next Steps**
- Create `abi.rs`, move `RawAbi*`, `parse_abi_functions()`, helpers; add unit tests.
- Update imports in `baml_adapter.rs` and consumers.

#### Session 3: Complete HandlerGenerator Integration Flow (Start 09:00Z, End 20:13Z)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- Needed end-to-end flow: Etherscan → transform → BAML → classification → HandlerGenerator integration.
- Implemented ABI parsing to BAML types, conversion to `ContractInfo`, and classification step.
- Validated workflow with DAO contract; handled markdown-wrapped JSON parsing issue.
- Status: ✅ Full pipeline working; classification verified.

**2. Code Changes**
- `crates/application/discovery/src/baml_adapter.rs` — Added integration helpers for Etherscan fetch/convert and classification.
- `crates/application/discovery/baml_src/functions.baml` — Ensured functions wired for classification.
- `crates/application/discovery/src/main.rs` — Example wiring and manual tests.

**3. Key Insights**
- End-to-end tests catch format quirks (markdown-wrapped JSON) that unit tests miss.
- BAML integration stable once input normalization is enforced.

**4. Documentation**
- Documented complete workflow and added test output notes for DAO contract.

**5. Next Steps**
- Batch processing; proxy/implementation detection; result caching; richer categories.

#### Session 4: Enhancing security for GitHub repositories (Start 09:24Z, End 23:56Z)

**1. Problem - Solutions**
- Concern about exposing secrets in `teamspace` and other repos.
- Evaluated additional free tools alongside GitGuardian: GitHub Secret Scanning (incl. Push Protection), Gitleaks (Action), TruffleHog (Action). Consider Snyk free tier.
- Status: ✅ Options identified with setup paths.

**2. Code Changes**
- Planning only; no code changes in repo yet.

**3. Key Insights**
- Enabling repo-native scanning (GitHub) with push protection reduces leakage at source.

**4. Documentation**
- Captured tool comparison and enablement steps.

**5. Next Steps**
- Enable GitHub secret scanning and push protection; add Gitleaks CI.
- Create pre-commit hook for local scans; publish security guidelines.

### Content Guidelines
- Included session start and end times.
- Focused on rationale and architectural decisions.
- Referenced key files: `etherscan.rs`, `baml_adapter.rs`, `functions.baml`, `main.rs`, `Cargo.toml`.
