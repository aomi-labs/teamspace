Meeting records [Transcript](?tab=t.ixv417r9s9u4) 

### Summary

The team provided updates on their respective progress, with David Thompson gaining a better understanding of smart contracts and storage handler integration into BAML, while Kevin Singh successfully imported Chisel's contract store functionality and created tests. The discussion also covered Chisel components and compiler usage, with Cecilia Zhang emphasizing the use of the Foundry compiler for core solidity compilation to avoid maintenance complexity. Additionally, HZ reported working on remaining integration tests for the Rust client and missing features, while Cecilia Zhang shared plans for fixing front-end issues, implementing a backend session store, and proposing a team workflow.

### Details

* **Weather Update** The team discussed the recent change in weather, noting that it has started raining and turning cold in Europe, Milan, and Italy. Kevin Singh and David Thompson also confirmed it was raining and chilly in their respective Canadian locations, with temperatures still around 17-20°C ([00:00:00](?tab=t.ixv417r9s9u4#heading=h.9i7034seiv88)).

* **David Thompson's Progress** David Thompson provided an update, indicating they have a better understanding of smart contracts and storage handler integration into BAML after a walk-through with Cecilia Zhang ([00:00:59](?tab=t.ixv417r9s9u4#heading=h.7k9ixkhs5ndl)). They expressed confidence in solving the problems laid out in the state machine and planned to start experimenting with unit tests and pushing code today ([00:02:14](?tab=t.ixv417r9s9u4#heading=h.r5t6sf4ynp03)).

* **Kevin Singh's Progress** Kevin Singh shared that they have successfully imported Chisel's contract store functionality into the project and created unit and integration tests ([00:02:14](?tab=t.ixv417r9s9u4#heading=h.r5t6sf4ynp03)). They noted that the system appears to be working and the next step is to hook in the BAML components for full testing ([00:03:17](?tab=t.ixv417r9s9u4#heading=h.aia00dfkwctd)).

* **Chisel Components and Compiler Usage** Kevin Singh explained that they pulled specific components from Chisel—the compiler, runner (EVM execution), and session management—after an analysis of the crate ([00:04:37](?tab=t.ixv417r9s9u4#heading=h.1i630edmzbbh)). Cecilia Zhang confirmed that using the Foundry compiler for core solidity compilation is the correct approach to avoid maintenance complexity, as it ensures synchronization with mainnet upgrades and avoids issues with Solidity updates ([00:06:00](?tab=t.ixv417r9s9u4#heading=h.ivq7q7w1vlmh)) ([00:08:22](?tab=t.ixv417r9s9u4#heading=h.2sp4usjd2kpc)).

* **EVM Config and Maintenance** Kevin Singh acknowledged the need to review the EVM config to distinguish between directly copied and newly built components, aiming to minimize maintenance. Cecilia Zhang emphasized the importance of balancing copied and directly used code to avoid frequent updates, especially considering Solidity updates and potential vulnerabilities ([00:07:25](?tab=t.ixv417r9s9u4#heading=h.pg8aulq421xg)).

* **Code Generation and Data Folder** Kevin Singh clarified that while tests involve generated code, execution scripts are not yet generated, with solidity code currently hardcoded in examples. They also inquired about the presence of flattened Solidity files in the data folder, to which Cecilia Zhang explained that flattened files are generated by the \`discover\` program from their TypeScript project and are usually ignored in the repository ([00:09:14](?tab=t.ixv417r9s9u4#heading=h.bp4nualjhgb)). Cecilia Zhang suggested running the \`discover\` program again on different contracts to understand what gets flattened ([00:10:41](?tab=t.ixv417r9s9u4#heading=h.7asqpwgrlkw2)).

* **HZ's Rust Client Updates** HZ reported working on remaining integration tests for the Rust client and completing missing features, including support for classes and asserts ([00:11:42](?tab=t.ixv417r9s9u4#heading=h.tew0fh5q1a9f)). They are still addressing map and literal types and noted that integration tests are manually written. HZ suggested an approach of learning from the Go implementation to implement everything, then verifying with integration tests, leveraging AI tools to understand Go code more effectively ([00:12:52](?tab=t.ixv417r9s9u4#heading=h.tbo7xhcmdx04)).

* **Cecilia Zhang's Backend and Workflow Initiatives** Cecilia Zhang shared that they are working on fixing front-end issues related to making it session-based and plan to implement a backend session store linked to unique user IDs and wallet identities ([00:16:42](?tab=t.ixv417r9s9u4#heading=h.bng7b69ll3nj)). They also presented a proposed team workflow involving \`spectory\` and Claude commands to automatically summarize daily work activities and push updates to a shared team space ([00:18:34](?tab=t.ixv417r9s9u4#heading=h.47jnarouo3ux)) ([00:27:32](?tab=t.ixv417r9s9u4#heading=h.d85ncb7q96js)). Cecilia Zhang plans to push these workflow resources, including meeting notes, to the team space repository with a README for guidance ([00:30:24](?tab=t.ixv417r9s9u4#heading=h.mmwi1oxy5b4b)).

* **AI Tool Comparison** HZ provided feedback on using CodeX with a GPT-5 model, noting its effective reasoning and ability to delve deep into code details for bug fixing. However, HZ expressed concern about the limited context size, which can lead to the model losing context after several rounds of chat, a potential issue that might also exist with Claude ([00:31:34](?tab=t.ixv417r9s9u4#heading=h.vw5r7sm93o8e)). HZ confirmed that CodeX also supports slash commands and the ability to define custom commands ([00:33:10](?tab=t.ixv417r9s9u4#heading=h.p269e7r8sp9m)).

### Suggested next steps

- [ ] David Thompson will do the unit test today.  
- [ ] Kevin Singh will pull in the BAML stuff and hook it in to fully test it, and will refine and clean up the EVM config and analyze what is directly copied.  
- [ ] Kevin Singh will try setting up the TypeScript project again, run it against an easy project, and play around to see if they can get the flattened files generated.  
- [ ] HZ will continue working on the approach of learning directly from Go's implementation and verifying with integration tests, and fixing errors in the generated integration tests.  
- [ ] Cecilia Zhang will fix the state in the TypeScript code for the frontend, implement a backend session store that relates to user data and likely tie it to a unique user ID with their wallet identity setup, and fix the script to update the date for the sync today command.  
- [ ] Cecilia Zhang will push the meeting resources, updates, meeting notes, Claude workflow, and a readme on how to update to the team space repo.  
- [ ] The group will go through the progress with the BAML founder tomorrow.
