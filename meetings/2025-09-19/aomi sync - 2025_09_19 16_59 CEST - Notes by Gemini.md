Meeting records [Transcript](?tab=t.2f5aizs6lm15) 

### Summary

Cecilia Zhang proposed using a GitHub repository as the team space to automate workflow and promote AI usage, with individual repositories pushing commits to a central team space repository for daily updates. Cecilia Zhang plans to automate this process, potentially integrating it with "spec story," and has already communicated expectations to Han and Kevin regarding this workflow.

### Details

* **Team Space Workflow** Cecilia Zhang proposed using a GitHub repository as the team space to automate workflow and promote the use of AI. The idea is to have each individual repository push commits to a central team space repository, enabling daily updates and compiling context with specific rules. Cecilia Zhang mentioned that this workflow would encourage team members, like Kevin, who are not currently AI users, to start using AI tools ([00:01:02](?tab=t.2f5aizs6lm15#heading=h.76amy134p51j)).

* **Automation and Implementation** Cecilia Zhang plans to automate the process of pushing updates to the team space, potentially integrating it with tools like "spec story," with implementation scheduled for the following week. Cecilia Zhang had previously sent specific expectations to Han and Kevin regarding this workflow ([00:01:02](?tab=t.2f5aizs6lm15#heading=h.76amy134p51j)).
