Meeting records [Transcript](?tab=t.4jdhrrhisk6n) 

### Summary

Cecilia Zhang and David Thompson discussed various project updates, including Cecilia Zhang's progress on front-end development, BAML integration, and unit testing strategies, and David Thompson's continued studies of LTB docs and BAML. They also deliberated on the distinct mindsets of marketing and engineering professionals, identifying Trenton as a strong candidate for a marketing/Dev Rel role. Finally, they confirmed the start dates for new hires Kevin and Han in mid-September, with Cecilia Zhang assigning Han to the BAML PR and Kevin to codegen, and agreed to make their repositories private to protect their strategic advantage.

### Details

* **Front-End Development Struggles** Cecilia Zhang expressed difficulties with front-end coding, noting that it requires significant attention and can be painful to refactor. She mentioned refactoring her front-end code using DOM and CSS classes, which reminded her of college ([00:00:00](?tab=t.4jdhrrhisk6n#heading=h.jexag7k3brm)).

* **David Thompson's BAML Studies** David Thompson shared that he is continuing to study LTB docs, watch YouTube videos, and read BAML-related materials. He is focusing on understanding template structures, their functions, and how they evolve over time, which has helped him grasp the utility of templates ([00:01:02](?tab=t.4jdhrrhisk6n#heading=h.bcsg1j97zu69)).

* **Understanding BAML Classes** Cecilia Zhang clarified that classes in BAML represent serialized parameters, unlike classes in regular programming languages that represent states ([00:04:52](?tab=t.4jdhrrhisk6n#heading=h.4t427n2j7evf)). She noted that naming conventions, such as "handler invocation params" instead of "handler invocations," help large language models (LLMs) interpret BAML classes more accurately ([00:06:05](?tab=t.4jdhrrhisk6n#heading=h.5acv5yjthaci)).

* **Testing BAML Integrations** Cecilia Zhang advised David Thompson to start with a basic end-to-end test for a storage slot handler to verify BAML integration and parameter flow. She suggested generating a BAML function for the storage slot handler and importing its parameters into client code for a single call to check if it correctly scrapes data ([00:08:37](?tab=t.4jdhrrhisk6n#heading=h.3vf5lyrq6cee)).

* **Unit Testing Strategy** Cecilia Zhang outlined a unit testing strategy, starting with elementary tests for individual handlers and then progressing to wider unit tests for handler invocation parameters ([00:11:05](?tab=t.4jdhrrhisk6n#heading=h.1qohac1ci6kx)). She emphasized that this approach will help in understanding the system's design and making sophisticated changes ([00:13:40](?tab=t.4jdhrrhisk6n#heading=h.vs97xxtyf5vx)).con

* **Frontend Development Progress** Cecilia Zhang reported that she is cleaning up the front-end code for the website, aiming for a polished display for upcoming investor meetings ([00:27:35](?tab=t.4jdhrrhisk6n#heading=h.qlpet6hn9xng)) ([00:34:08](?tab=t.4jdhrrhisk6n#heading=h.6ny2p0r5ekjl)). She is also working on integrating the chatbot and front-end in the same folder and has implemented a message type in the front-end to adapt the backend directly to the front-end component ([00:29:20](?tab=t.4jdhrrhisk6n#heading=h.pa3jdu6mjw2y)).

* **Wallet Connection and Third Web** Cecilia Zhang mentioned her efforts to support actual mainnet transactions and wallet connections, acknowledging that this is a new area for her as a blockchain developer. David Thompson suggested looking into Third Web tools, sharing a tutorial on connecting a web app with a wallet connect button to an NFT contract ([00:35:12](?tab=t.4jdhrrhisk6n#heading=h.wk31xv89tw79)).

* **Ethereum AI Community and Benchmarking** Cecilia Zhang plans to add David Thompson to an Ethereum AI group chat, noting that while some discussions can be "cringe," it is good to be aware of other projects ([00:37:41](?tab=t.4jdhrrhisk6n#heading=h.q9ijfm50ihwj)). She proposed creating a community benchmark called "cryptobench" similar to "terminal bench" to evaluate agents on tasks ranging from ERC20 transfers to cross-chain price oracle updates in a unified environment ([00:40:47](?tab=t.4jdhrrhisk6n#heading=h.olyf5norbeyj)).

* **Marketing vs. Engineering Mindset** Cecilia Zhang and David Thompson discussed the distinct characteristics of marketing and engineering professionals. They concluded that while engineers are typically honest and specific, marketers often require a different approach, being more "fast and loose with the truth" and relentless in their pursuit of exposure ([00:44:25](?tab=t.4jdhrrhisk6n#heading=h.ipxoyrhmjrre)) ([00:47:30](?tab=t.4jdhrrhisk6n#heading=h.aeao0h1oya8e)).

* **Candidate for Marketing/Dev Rel Role** Cecilia Zhang and David Thompson identified Trenton as a potential candidate for a marketing or Developer Relations (Dev Rel) role, noting their enthusiastic and relentless nature, and their ability to grasp high-level concepts and engage with the community ([00:46:35](?tab=t.4jdhrrhisk6n#heading=h.cq8td8io3cac)) ([00:48:21](?tab=t.4jdhrrhisk6n#heading=h.jb0bawal52gm)). They contrasted this with the typical engineering mindset, which values directness and honesty ([00:45:36](?tab=t.4jdhrrhisk6n#heading=h.85yqpggyrn9x)).

* **Audience and Strategy** Cecilia Zhang reflected on the challenge of identifying their target audience—whether crypto or AI people—and considered maintaining a stealth startup approach ([00:53:39](?tab=t.4jdhrrhisk6n#heading=h.4yixobr2mode)). Both agreed on prioritizing product development, getting the website fully functional, and understanding user interests through feedback ([00:55:08](?tab=t.4jdhrrhisk6n#heading=h.os5p9hp147gd)).

* **New Hires and Project Assignments** Cecilia Zhang and David Thompson discussed the start dates for new hires, Kevin and Han, in mid-September. Cecilia Zhang plans for Han to work on the BAML PR, noting it is mostly complete and only requires fixing a compilation bug, which should be manageable for someone with Han's system engineering background ([00:55:50](?tab=t.4jdhrrhisk6n#heading=h.cysks5ef3ev)). For Kevin, Cecilia Zhang intends to assign them to codegen, specifically starting from the contract store in Aomi, where they will work on code generation after contracts have been scraped and flattened ([00:56:55](?tab=t.4jdhrrhisk6n#heading=h.i9b3nwate42)). This approach aims to divide the work to prevent overlap and ensure clarity in tasks ([00:58:02](?tab=t.4jdhrrhisk6n#heading=h.gwmdp8o5uwu7)).

* **Repository Privacy** David Thompson raised the issue of public repositories, including their coding assignment, due to not being on the same team previously, and suggested making them private. Cecilia Zhang agreed, emphasizing the need to keep most repositories private until their "moat" or strategic advantage is defined, to avoid revealing their plans. David Thompson confirmed they would also make their repository private ([00:58:02](?tab=t.4jdhrrhisk6n#heading=h.gwmdp8o5uwu7)).
